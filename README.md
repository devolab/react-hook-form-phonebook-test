# react-hook-form PhoneBook v3 - Front End Test

This is a code written for a front-end test to display primarily the way to use SOLID principles and react-hook-form for a phonebook web app.
Please NOTE: This site has been used and tested ONLY on Chrome.

For this test, I've used the following techs:
- React 18.2
- React Hooks (custom and pre-defined)
- Javascript
- Typescript
- SASS
- react-hook-form (to handle all the parts of the search field)
- Axios (for API requests)

## Getting Started

Firstly, please follow these instructions:

1. Go to your terminal and open the folder where you want to clone the app
2. Copy and paste the following line to bootstrap the app: `git clone https://github.com/devolab/react-hook-form-phonebook-v3-test.git`
3. Once the clone has been completed, write: `react-hook-form-phonebook-v3-test`
4. Write: `yarn` to install the node_modules
5. To start the development environment, run: `yarn start`
6. Your browser should open running the application on `localhost:3000`. If it doesn't, please open a new browser window and type: `localhost:3000`
